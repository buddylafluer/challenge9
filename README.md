  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
  This project is a professional README generator which enables users to create a high quality README without the troubles of follwing proper syntax and guidlines.
  I created this project for users who don't wish to spend a lot of time on their README but would still like for it to be up to professional standards.
  This application will be used by simply answering the questions prompted and watching as a ready to use README is generated for them.
  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
  To install this project either download the code from the repository or clone the repository into the directory of your choice.
  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
  Once the project is installed, open your command line and run "node index.js". You should then be presented with a series of prompts and upon completion of those prompts you will be supplied with a ready to use README to copy into your project.
